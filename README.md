**Cloud Migration Plan: Bank of Montreal (BMO) Case Study**

1. **Motivators for Cloud Migration:**

Bank of Montreal chooses to migrate into cloud thanks to its scalability, cost efficiency, and performance. The bank needs its dynamic scaling to manage risk with increasing complexity. Moreover, the bank’s infrastructure and operational costs have reduced by 30% ever since their switch to Azure. The performance’s improvement is also remarkable. They can run jobs twice as fast and processing scaling up to 80,000 cores per night using VMs if needed.

1. **Key Questions to Understand infrastructure:**

- What is the current on-premises infrastructure (compute capacity, software stack, etc.)?
- How are data workloads distributed (batch processing, real-time analysis)?
- Which compliance standards must be adhered to (e.g., GDPR, financial regulations)?

1. **RACI Matrix for Migration Stakeholders:**

| **Task** | **Responsible** | **Accountable** | **Consulted** | **Informed** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud Strategy & Planning | CIO/CTO | CIO | Cloud Architects, CFO | IT Operations |
| Migration Execution | Cloud Engineers | Project Manager | IT Infrastructure | Business Units |
| Compliance and Security | Security Team | CIO | Compliance Team, Legal | IT Team |
| Testing & Optimization | DevOps Team | Cloud Lead | IT Ops, Security Team | Business Units |
| Training & Support | IT Ops | Project Manager | Cloud Engineers | End Users |

**4\. Migration Approach:**

The **Replatforming** approach suits BMO, given the complexity and need to enhance cloud-native capabilities while maintaining flexibility.

**5\. High-Level Schedule:**

- **Month 1-6**: Assessment, Discussing and Developing an on-premises prototype
- **Month 7-8**: Model fine-tuning, Stress-testing, user training, and handover.

**6\. Main Decision Criteria:**

- **Cost vs. Performance Trade-Off**: Optimizing cloud resources for maximum performance at a 30% cost reduction.
- **Compliance and Security**: Ensuring data security in Azure meets financial regulatory standards.
- **Scalability**: Ability to dynamically scale computing power based on daily risk analysis demands.
- **Vendor Reliability**: Confidence in Microsoft’s support, especially regarding high-performance computing needs and disaster recovery planning.
